            <Dropdown title="Do renovations increase my home&apos;s value?">
              <p>Yes! A renovated kitchen, for instance, can potentially <ExternalLink href="https://homesenator.com/how-much-does-a-kitchen-increase-your-homes-value/" target="_blank">boost a home&apos;s resale value by up to 15%</ExternalLink>. Homeowners might recoup between 60% to 80% of the renovation costs, depending on the scale and specifics of the project. The return on investment for kitchen upgrades can make renovations a wise financial decision for those considering selling their home in the futureâ€‹.</p>

Renovating these spaces can not only refresh and modernize a home&apos;s interior but also address the wear and tear that accumulates over decades. Kitchens and bathrooms from this era often lack the open layouts, energy-efficient appliances, and modern conveniences that newer homes today have. Upgrading your kitchen or bathroom can significantly enhance your living experience, improve energy efficiency, and increase the overall value of your home. <InternalLink href="/contact">Contact us</InternalLink> to start your renovation project today!</p>
